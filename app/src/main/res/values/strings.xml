    <string name="minionWish">"You are the strongest support in my life, and I am blessed to have a true friend like you who has always stood by me through the most challenging times. Sometimes I feel that had you not been there in my life, it would have been such a boring and dull life. You are the cheese to my pizza and maple syrup to my pancake because I cannot imagine my life without you. I still look back to when I first met you in kindergarten, and we connected instantly. Nobody would have thought that we will come this far, but now I know that we are friends for life and no matter what happens in the future, we are always going to stick around. It is not easy to live with you, but it is all the more difficult to live without you. You are that friend to me who will first laugh at me when I fall and then come to help me. But no matter how crazy and weird you are, you will always be my special friend and will find me right next to you. On your birthday, I wish that all your dreams come true and you are showered with happiness and success in life."</string>

    <string name="wishme">"Message from me"</string>
    <string name="wishme2">"Dear friend,

Many years have passed since we met on the road, who was going to tell us! It is a bit of vertigo to look back because, when you do, it is when you realize that the years go by too fast. However, you also realize how wonderful it is to see life move forward and that you still have some people to your side, unconditionally, willing to live everything with you and get the funniest side of everything that happens to you.

Gone are all the afternoons of the university in the cafeteria, eating and drinking on the lawn, organizing some classwork. At the same time, we wanted to go home or staying to stay for dinner and then go out to party with great makeup and ready to give everything dancing. Those times were good, but I wouldn‚Äôt trade them for what we have today. Not for nothing, but because a lot of things have happened to us along the way, we have been evolving, changing, living longer, and we have done all that together. Can you ask a friend for something more beautiful?

They say that birthdays are the perfect opportunity to make a ‚Äòremember‚Äô of those things and I can‚Äôt agree more! Today, on your birthday, I go back to college and our ‚Äúinnocent‚Äù expectations to review each of the trips we have made together (and their anecdotes). Missing a train at minus 11 degrees? Make friends from other countries? Cry with laughter at any anecdote? Tirelessly planning a trip? Throw ourselves on the beach to reflect on life and our plans for the future? Tell us the past without fear of judging ourselves? I would live every moment with you again. We have cried, we have accompanied each other in bad times, and we have been happy for all the good ones because, after all, that is what friendship consists of. And when a certain date arrives, like your birthday, I cannot be happier to continue adding plots and years to our history. I‚Äôm so glad to have you as a friend.

Finally, in this year that you start, I am not going to wish you the typical (otherwise, it would not be me). I wish you this ‚Äúnew year‚Äù that begins today to laugh until your abs hurt (those that will never hurt from playing sports, and you know it), that they surprise you until you drop your jaw, that you hug (in the distance) as if the most distant were by your side and, above all, that you learn to appreciate the details that this new stage has prepared for you. Because at the end of the day, that‚Äôs what happiness and life consist of. In making the most of those details and knowing how to value them.

I‚Äôm sure there will be a lot of good things coming to you. Happy Birthday!

Your friend loves you. "</string>
